# Neural_network
Simple binary classification neural network.

The objective of the neural network is to classify which circle each point belongs to. To do this, the network is trained with the training data and then the training error is compared with the error of the test data. You can change the learning rate, the number of neurons, layers, activation functions and iterations to see how the error varies.
